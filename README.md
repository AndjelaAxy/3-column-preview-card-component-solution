### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

- HTML - I used semantic tags.
- CSS - For the first time I used grid layout so I could divide div better, it helped me a lot. Beside grid I also used flexbox.
- Media query for responsive design - This time was so easy to change the layout, only few features.

### Built with

- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
